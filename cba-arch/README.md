## Component-Based Architecture

This is a simple application that uses the component-based architecture to display a list of users. The application is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Mantine UI
- TanStack Query
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios

### Overview

Component-Based Architecture is a software design pattern that structures an application into a collection of independent, reusable components. Each component represents a specific part of the user interface or functionality, and can be composed together to form more complex components.

### Key Principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single responsibility, and should not be responsible for multiple tasks.
2. **Reusability**: Components should be reusable across the application, and should not be tied to a specific implementation.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Components should be separated by their concerns, and should not be tightly coupled.
4. **Composability**: Components should be composed together to form more complex components.
5. **Data Flow**: Data should flow from parent to child components, and should not be passed through multiple levels of components.

### Best Practices:

1. **Component Design**

- Keep components small and focused on a single task
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop validation
- Consistent naming convention and folder structure
- Document component APIs

2. **State Management**

- Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible
- Use global state sparingly and only when necessary
- Normalize complex state structures

3. **Performance Optimization**

- Use memoization and lazy loading
- Use code splitting to load components only when needed (optimize bundle size and page load time)
- Use server-side rendering when possible
- Use caching to improve performance

4. **Code Organization**

- Group related components/files together
- Use barrel exports to simplify imports
- Maintain consistent folder structure
- Separate concerns clearly (e.g. components, hooks, utils, etc.)

## Summary

This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for building large-scale web applications. By following the principles and best practices outlined in this document, developers can create high-quality, performant, and easy-to-maintain applications.

## Running the application

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
